            <br>
            Year 8 Season 4 brings Operation Deep Freeze to Rainbow 
            6 Siege, letting players delve into a plethora of changes 
            in the game. Some of the upcoming season’s highlights

            to forget, a change in meta.</b></p>

        <h2>New Defender ‘Tubarao’</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            Rainbow Six Siege Operation Deep Freeze 
            introduces Tubarao, the new operator 
            hailing from Ponta Delgada in Portugal. 
            He belongs to the Wolfguard group which 
            includes the likes of Doc, Rook, Thunderbird, 
            Twitch, and more.
            <br>
            <br>
            His primary gadget, the Zoto Canister, 
            is a throwable device that sticks to 
            surfaces, releases a freezing gas, 
            deactivates gadgets, exposes footprints, 
            and slows down attacks. This means 
            Tubarao can be an excellent operator to 
            pair with other defenders like Bandit and 
            Pulse.</b></p>

        <h2>Tubarao’s weapons and gadgets</h2>
        <hr>
        <strong><ul style="padding-left: 3%; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 3%;">
            <li>Primary Weapons: <i>MPX, AR-15.50</i></li>
            <li>Secondary Weapons: <i>P226 MK 25</i></li>
            <li>Primary Gadget: <i>Zoto Canister (a total of four)</i></li>
            <li>Secondary Gadgets: <i>Nitro Cell, Proximity Alarm</i></li>
        </ul></strong>

        <h2>New map ‘Lair’</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            Lair is the new map that Operation Deep 
            Freeze brings along and it’s a secret 
            headquarters in the middle of a giant 
            cave! It has a ton of entry points for 
            Attackers and features a total of four 
            bomb sites.
            <br>
            <br>
            Defenders might have a hard time defending 
            this map without proper strategies as they 
            can get shot down from a multitude of angles. 
            Regardless, it will be interesting to see how 
            good Lair proves to be in the competitive R6 
            scene.</b></p>

        <h2>Defender AI playlist & Frag Grenade rework</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            A new Defender AI playlist will debut with 
            Operation Deep Freeze, replacing Terrorist 
            Hunt, colloquially known as ‘THunt’. This 
            playlist gives you the option to either go 
            solo or find four more teammates against a 
            stack of five AI bots. The scenarios mimic 
            casual matches.
            <br>
            <br>
            Frag Grenades have been reworked in the new 
            season. Starting Y8S4, you can’t cook these 
            grenades anymore. Meaning, gone are the days 
            when you yellow ping a spot beneath a defender’s 
            floor and get an easy frag. This has been done 
            to not make these gadgets as powerful as a 
            primary utility.
            <br>
            <br>
            The frag grenades will now function in a 
            similar way as stun grenades. This means 
            it will fuze 2 seconds after bouncing off 
            a surface. Some more operators like IQ, 
            Lion, Sens, Osa, and Blackbeard have got 
            these grenades now.</b></p>

        <h2>New ‘Marketplace’</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            Marketplace is a new concept in Rainbow 6 
            where you can trade items with the community 
            using in-game Credits. Remember, the Credits 
            are the premium currency of the game unlike 
            Renown, which you earn by playing matches.
            <br>
            <br>
            This will include different cosmetics, headgear, 
            and a lot more. In Y8S4, the Marketplace will 
            launch followed by a full release in Year 9. To 
            get access to the Marketplace beta, you need to 
            register which you can do from Ubisoft’s official 
            website.</b></p>
