        <h2>Reworked Perks System</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            One of the biggest changes in Cyberpunk’s 2.0 
            update is that the Attribute and Character Perk 
            skill trees have been massively overhauled. It 
            now provides much more focused perks so you can 
            better craft a build that suits your playstyle. 
            For those jumping into Phantom Liberty, you’ll 
            also be introduced to a brand new Relic tree, 
            which features a variety of exciting new perks, 
            from Emergency Cloaking to new abilities for 
            your arm Cyberware. Unlike the regular perk tree, 
            the Relic tree uses specific Relic points that 
            can be earned while in Dogtown and is exclusive 
            to the Phantom Liberty expansion.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the exciting new perks in the 2.0 update 
            are Hack Queue, which lets you queue up multiple 
            quick hacks at once; Air Dash, which allows you 
            to move swiftly through the air; Quake, which 
            lets you pulverize a group of enemies all at 
            once; and Lead and Steel, which allows you to 
            block incoming projectiles with a blade. Many 
            of these new and reworked perks also feature 
            brand-new, flashy animations, which makes them 
            even more enjoyable.</b></p>

        <h2>Vehicle Combat</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            With the 2.0 update, you can be just as dangerous 
            behind the wheel as you are behind the trigger. 
            With the new vehicle-on-vehicle combat, you’re 
            able to shoot from inside of your car for high-
            speed battles. And thanks to the new Carhacker 
            perk, you can also use your cyberware to remotely 
            hack your way into enemy vehicles. This includes 
            messing with their brakes, going pedal to the 
            metal with their gas, or even blowing them up.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some cars even have mounted guns, so you can 
            truly go wild on the streets of Night City. 
            According to CDPR, most of the cars with mounted 
            guns are exclusive to Phantom Liberty. However, 
            players who own just the base game will find 
            updated Aldecados cars fitted with mounted weaponry.</b></p>

        <h2>Armor and Cyberware Changes</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            Cyberware and armor have seen some big 
             in the 2.0 update as well. Now, there’s 
             a limit on how much cyberware you can have 
             installed at one time, which is tied to 
             your level. As you level up the amount of 
             cyberware you can install increases.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cyberware is also now tied to armor, a stat 
            that originally used to be an aspect of the 
            clothing you wore. With this change, your 
            cyberware installments can feel like more 
            impactful decisions that help you feel more 
            powerful in a number of ways as you explore 
            Night City.</b></p>

        <h2>Stamina and Weapons</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            Stamina used to be tied to your movement and 
            melee combat, but now firing a weapon and 
            dashing/dodging will drain it. So, while 
            you’ll be able to traverse the world of Night 
            City without running out of breath, this new 
            update adds some tension to combat as you’ll 
            now have to keep an eye on your stamina meter 
            as you take on enemies. This new stamina bar 
            can be seen in the top left corner of your 
            screen, as shown in the photo above.</b></p>

        <h2>Updated Ripperdoc Interactions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            The Ripperdocs have gotten an upgrade with 
            the 2.0 update as well. The UI has been 
            switched up to make choosing the cyberware 
            you want a bit easier, and there’s also an 
            animation now that shows you getting up from 
            the chair after a surgery (along with a few 
            sound effects during it to immerse you in 
            the process). This has made interactions with 
            Ripperdocs feel a touch more true to the 
            Cyberpunk experience, so when you settle in 
            for a surgery, you can feel more absorbed 
            in the process.</b></p>

        <h2>Updated Police AI</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            With the 2.0 update, you’ll need to stay on 
            your toes while exploring Night City as well, 
            as the police’s AI have been significantly 
            improved. Your illegal actions won’t slip by 
            all that easily anymore, as the police now 
            dynamically react to what you do. Similar to 
            GTA, there’s an escalation system (or ‘Heat’ 
            level) in place that increases in correlation 
            with the level of crime you’ve committed. 
            Commit too many crimes, and you’ll likely have 
            quite the run-in with the NCPD, and may even 
            end up in a chase!
            <br>
            <br>
            Alongside the NCPD, enemies in groups will 
            also be more aware of you and your actions. 
            Should you push their buttons, they even adapt 
            to V’s difficulty level, so they’ll be ready 
            to take you on in a proper fight.</b></p>

        <h2>General Changes</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-top: 2%;"><b>
            Alongside the above-mentioned changes in the 
            2.0 update, there are a variety of smaller 
            updates that have been implemented as well. 
            Various UI improvements have been made, there 
            are three new radio stations to jam out to, 
            and you now start with two healing items that 
            recharge after they’re used. This is also 
            applied to grenades, so when you’re in combat, 
            you’ll need to be mindful of how often you’re 
            using them.</b></p>
